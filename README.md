This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Inspired by EBay, the Lookin' Sharp React/ Redux application is a place where service industry professionals and knife enthusiasts can upload, share and sell their knives in a comfortable and convenient way. Built with the React and Redux frameworks, Lookin' Sharp is a single page application, written in Javascript. The backend was built with Ruby on Rails. To start it up, navigate to the sharp-backend repository and run npm start. Then navigate to the sharp-frontend repository and run npm start, which will ask you to run it on a secondary port. Select yes, and you can begin.
